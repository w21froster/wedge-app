# WEDGE Decentralized Chat Application

This is our submission for our 322 project. 
This is a decentralized chat application loosely based on the work done by Fireship. https://github.com/fireship-io/gun-chat
Most of the Svelte components were built from the ground up, and we impoved on the messaging components from Fireship. 
We used Gun.JS, Svelte, Bootstrap, and NodeJS to complete this project.
